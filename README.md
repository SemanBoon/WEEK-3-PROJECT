* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
  -Initially, I had alot of issues linking the frontend to the backend for this project and my code was filled with errors but the moment I was able to connect the dots, everything went well
